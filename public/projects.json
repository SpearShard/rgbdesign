The project reimagines the future of urban environments through adaptive spatial infrastructure. The system transcends traditional architectural boundaries by introducing a Prototypical System composed of intelligent, self-assembling units capable of dynamic reconfiguration in response to urban needs and changes. These spheroidal units, equipped with telescopic legs and electromagnets, interact and rearrange themselves into various urban elements, demonstrating collective intelligence and flexibility. Beyond mere physical structures, Orb[i]s integrates advanced sensory systems and machine learning to enhance user interaction and adaptability, offering a visionary approach to urban development that champions adaptability, responsiveness, and the seamless integration of technology and architecture to foster new forms of cultural and urban spaces."]

All the segments of the seater were efficiently designed to make optimal use of the limited material available. The temporary yet sustainable Installation was used by several artists for their performances.The seater endured 1000’s of users and uses whilst serving a different function/experience to each one."]
